# obsidian-rs

This is a Rust library for interacting with existingObsidian vaults.

This is a work in progress, which started as a simple proof of concept in [md2ms](https://github.com/adamisrael/md2ms) but is growing complex enough that I've moved it into its own library in order to reuse the work for other projects.

Right now, the core functionality is focused on installing and uninstalling community plugins from an Obsidian vault.

If you find this crate useful but not working for your specific use case, please open an issue on GitHub.
